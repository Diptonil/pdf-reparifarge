# PDF Reparifarge

- Some fairly simple transfiguration for a PDF to alter its properties and metadata. 
- Created because I felt the need to alter the metadata for an inconsequential, yet compulsory document that I could easily copy, edit and send.
- Bring your edited PDFs here, run the program and exchange metadata you don't want for the one that you do. 
- *Reparifarge* is a transfiguration spell using in Harry Potter to undo the effects of a disastrous transformation. In some ways, that's what we are doing here too. XD
